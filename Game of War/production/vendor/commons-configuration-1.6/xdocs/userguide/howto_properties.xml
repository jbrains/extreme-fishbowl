    <section name="Properties files">
      <p>
        Properties files are a popular mean of configuring applications. Of course Commons Configuration
        supports this format and enhances significantly the basic <code>java.util.Properties</code> class.
        This section introduces the features of the 
        <code><a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/PropertiesConfiguration.html">PropertiesConfiguration</a></code> class.
        Note that <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code> is a very typical example
        for an implementation of the <code>Configuration</code> interface and
        many of the features described in this section (e.g. list handling or
        interpolation) are supported by other configuration classes as well.
        This is because most configuration implementations that ship with
        Commons Configuration are derived from the common base class
        <code><a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/AbstractConfiguration.html">AbstractConfiguration</a></code>,
        which implementes this features.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Using PropertiesConfiguration">
        <p>
          Let's start with a simple properties file named
          <code>usergui.properties</code> with the following content:
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
# Properties definining the GUI
colors.background = #FFFFFF
colors.foreground = #000080

window.width = 500
window.height = 300
]]></source>

        <p>
          To load this file, you'll write:
        </p>
<source>
Configuration config = new PropertiesConfiguration("usergui.properties");
</source>
        <p>
          If you do not specify an absolute path, the file will be searched automatically
          in the following locations:
          <ul>
            <li>in the current directory</li>
            <li>in the user home directory</li>
            <li>in the classpath</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of using a constructor that takes a file name you can also
          invoke one of the <code>load()</code> methods. There are several
          overloaded variants that allow you to load properties from various
          sources. More information about loading properties files (and file-based
          configurations in general) can be found in the section about
          <a href="howto_filebased.html">File-based Configurations</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the properties file was loaded you can access its content through
          the methods of the <code>Configuration</code> interface, e.g.
        </p>
<source>
String backColor = config.getString("colors.background");
Dimension size = new Dimension(config.getInt("window.width"),
  config.getInt("window.height"));
</source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Includes">
        <p>
          If a property is named "<code>include</code>" and the value of that property is the
          name of a file on the disk, that file will be included into the configuration. Here is
          an example:
        </p>
<source>
# usergui.properties

include = colors.properties
include = sizes.properties
</source>

<source>
# colors.properties

colors.background = #FFFFFF
</source>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Lists and arrays">
        <p>
          As was already pointed out in the section
          <a href="howto_basicfeatures.html#List_handling">List handling</a>
          of <em>Basic features</em>, Commons Configuration has the ability to
          return easily a list of values. For example a properties file can
          contain a list of comma separated values:
        </p>
<source>
# chart colors
colors.pie = #FF0000, #00FF00, #0000FF
</source>
        <p>
          You don't have to split the value manually, you can retrieve an array
          or a <code>java.util.List</code> directly with:
        </p>
<source>
String[] colors = config.getStringArray("colors.pie");
List colorList = config.getList("colors.pie");
</source>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you can specify a list of values in your properties file by using
          the same key on several lines:
        </p>
<source>
# chart colors
colors.pie = #FF0000;
colors.pie = #00FF00;
colors.pie = #0000FF;
</source>
        <p>
          All of the features related to list handling described for
          <code>AbstractConfiguration</code> also apply to properties files,
          including changing the list delimiter or disabling list handling at
          all.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Saving">
        <p>
          To save your configuration, just call the <code>save()</code> method:
        </p>
<source>
PropertiesConfiguration config = new PropertiesConfiguration("usergui.properties");
config.setProperty("colors.background", "#000000);
config.save();
</source>
        <p>
          You can also save a copy of the configuration to another file:
        </p>
<source>
PropertiesConfiguration config = new PropertiesConfiguration("usergui.properties");
config.setProperty("colors.background", "#000000);
config.save("usergui.backup.properties);
</source>
        <p>
          More information about saving properties files (and file-based
          configurations in general) can be found in the section about
          <a href="howto_filebased.html">File-based Configurations</a>.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Special Characters">
        <p>
          If you need a special character in a property like a line feed, a tabulation or
          an unicode character, you can specify it with the same escaped notation used for
          Java Strings. The list separator ("," by default), can also be escaped:
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
key = This \n string \t contains \, escaped \\ characters \u0020
]]></source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Layout Objects">
      <p>
        Each <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code> object is associated with a
        <em>Layout object</em>, an instance of the class
        <code><a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/PropertiesConfigurationLayout.html">
        PropertiesConfigurationLayout</a></code>. This layout object is
        responsible for preserving most of the structure of loaded configuration
        files. This means that things like comments or blanc lines in a saved
        properties file will closely resemble the original properties file
        (the algorithm is not 100 percent perfect, but for most use cases it
        should be sufficient).
      </p>
      <p>
        Normally a developer does not have to deal with these layout objects.
        However there are some methods that might be of interest in certain use
        cases. For instance <code>PropertiesConfigurationLayout</code> defines
        methods for obtaining and setting the comment for a property key. A
        header comment for the whole properties file is also supported. If the
        values of multi-valued properties should always be written on a
        single line rather than adding a new property definition for each value
        (which would be incompatible with <code>java.util.Properties</code>)
        the <code>setForceSingleLine()</code> method can be used.
      </p>
