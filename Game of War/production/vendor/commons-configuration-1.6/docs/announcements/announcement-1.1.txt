The commons-configuration team is pleased to announce the Commons 
Configuration 1.1 release! 

http://commons.apache.org/configuration/

Tools to assist in the reading of configuration/preferences files in various 
formats 

Changes in this version include:

  Changes:

o Fixed a ConcurrentModificationException thrown when calling clear() on a 
  SubsetConfiguration applied to a BaseConfiguration. Issue: 
  CONFIGURATION-134. 
o The resolveContainerStore() method in AbstractConfiguration now works 
  properly with arrays of objects and arrays of primitives. This means it is 
  possible to store an array of value in the configuration and retrieve the 
  first element with the getString(), getInt()... methods. Issue: 
  CONFIGURATION-81.  

Have fun!
