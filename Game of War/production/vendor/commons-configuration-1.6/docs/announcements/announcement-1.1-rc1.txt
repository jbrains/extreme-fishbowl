The commons-configuration team is pleased to announce the Commons 
Configuration 1.1-rc1 release! 

http://commons.apache.org/configuration/

Tools to assist in the reading of configuration/preferences files in various 
formats 

Changes in this version include:

  New Features:

o ConfigurationFactory now always configures digester to use the context 
  classloader. This avoids problems in application server environments, which 
  use their own version of digester. Thanks to Mike Colbert for the patch! 
  Issue: CONFIGURATION-88. 
o Added a new configuration, XMLPropertiesConfiguration, supporting the new 
  XML format for java.util.Properties introduced in Java 1.5. A 1.5 runtime 
  is not required to use this class. Issue: CONFIGURATION-148. 
o Added a comment header to PropertiesConfiguration. The header is not parsed 
  when the file is loaded yet. Issue: CONFIGURATION-190. 
o Added the setEncoding(String) and the getEncoding() methods to the 
  FileConfiguration interface to control the encoding of the configuration 
  file. 
o Access to the top level element of the XML document is now provided. For 
  newly created configurations this element can be changed before the 
  document is written. Issue: CONFIGURATION-210. 
o Added implementation of a save() method for HierarchicalXMLConfiguration. 
  Issue: CONFIGURATION-187. 
o Saving a configuration now creates the path to the file if it doesn't 
  exist. 
o Added support for optional configuration sources in definition files for 
  ConfigurationFactory. A new optional attribute allows to specify whether a 
  configuration source is mandatory or optional. Issue: CONFIGURATION-162. 
o Added two methods copy(Configuration, Configuration) and 
  append(Configuration, Configuration) in ConfigurationUtils to copy 
  properties between configurations. 
o File based configurations can now be automatically reloaded when the 
  underlying file is modified. Issue: CONFIGURATION-147. 
o Added a clear() method to the Configuration interface to remove all 
  properties. Issue: CONFIGURATION-156. 
o Added a SystemConfiguration wrapping the system properties. 
  ConfigurationFactory recognizes the corresponding &amp;lt;system/&amp;gt; element. 
  Issue: CONFIGURATION-208. 
o Added a MapConfiguration to turn any Map into a Configuration. The 
  getConfiguration() methods in ConfigurationConverter now use 
  MapConfiguration, as a result the Configuration returned is always 
  synchronized with the underlying Properties or ExtendedProperties, changes 
  made to the Configuration are available in the Properties, and 
  reciprocally. 
o The "autoSave" feature of XMLConfiguration has been generalized to all file 
  based configurations. Issue: CONFIGURATION-146. 
o Numeric properties can now be specified in hexadecimal format, for example 
  "number = 0xC5F0". Issue: CONFIGURATION-191. 
o Added a DataConfiguration decorator providing getters for all useful types 
  found in a configuration (URL, Locale, Date, Calendar, Color, lists and 
  arrays) 
o Added 5 new configurations to be used in a web environment: 
  AppletConfiguration, ServletConfiguration, ServletContextConfiguration, 
  ServletRequestConfiguration, ServletFilterConfiguration. 

  Fixed bugs:

o Some cleanup of the handling of the base path in file based configurations. 
  The base path is now always taken into account. Issue: CONFIGURATION-15. 
o Calling getProperties on a JNDIConfiguration no longer throws an 
  UnsupportedOperationException. 
o ConfigurationUtils.locate() now checks if the URL based resources exist. 
  This fixes a bug preventing configuration files from being found if the 
  configuration descriptor is in a JAR file (reported by Grant Ingersoll). 
o Fixed NPE that were caused in the constructors of file based configurations 
  if an invalid file name was specified. Issue: CONFIGURATION-96. 
o JNDIConfiguration.getKeys() now returns an empty iterator instead of 
  throwing a ConfigurationRuntimeException when a NamingException occurs. The 
  NamingExceptions are now logged. 
o DatabaseConfiguration.isEmpty() now returns true if an SQLException occurs. 
o Fixed HierarchicalConfiguration.getKeys(String), it returned an empty 
  iterator if the prefix string contained indices. Issue: CONFIGURATION-36. 

  Changes:

o Merged the two XML related configuration classes into one new class 
  XMLConfiguration. This new class should provide the best of its ancestors. 
  Issue: CONFIGURATION-168. 
o Replaced the PropertyTokenizer inner class in AbstractConfiguration with 
  the split method in PropertyConverter. Also moved the method building an 
  iterator on the elements of a composite value in PropertyConverter as 
  toIterator(). 
o Constructing a file based configuration with a File no longer throws an 
  exception when the file doesn't exist. 
o AbstractFileConfiguration.save(File) no longer fails silently when an error 
  occurs, a ConfigurationException is thrown instead. Issue: 
  CONFIGURATION-45. 
o Moved the constructors implementations from PropertiesConfiguration and 
  XMLConfiguration to AbstractFileConfiguration. 

  Removed features:

o Removed the getPropertyDirect method from AbstractConfiguration, concrete 
  configurations now implement directly the getProperty method from the 
  Configuration interface. 
o Remove deprecated getVector() implementations.  

Have fun!
