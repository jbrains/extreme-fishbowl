/**
 * <p>
 * Definition of an interface for evaluating keys for hierarchical
 * configurations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An <em>expression engine</em> knows how to map a key for a configuration's
 * property to a single or a set of configuration nodes. Thus it defines the way
 * how properties are addressed in this configuration. Methods of a
 * configuration that have to handle property key (e.g.
 * <code>getProperty()</code> or <code>addProperty()</code> do not interpret
 * the passed in keys on their own, but delegate this task to an associated
 * expression engine. This expression engine will then find out, which
 * configuration nodes are addressed by the key.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Seperating the task of evaluating property keys from the configuration object
 * has the advantage that many different expression languages (i.e. ways for
 * querying or setting properties) can be supported. Just set a suitable
 * implementation of this interface as the configuration's expression engine,
 * and you can use the syntax provided by this implementation.
 * </p>
