 * Definition of a <em>Visitor</em> interface for a configuration node

 * which simplifies traversal of a complex node hierarchy. A configuration node
 * implementation must provide a way of visiting all nodes in the current
 * hierarchy. This is a typical application of the GoF <em>Visitor</em>
 * pattern.
