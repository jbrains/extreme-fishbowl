/**
 * <p>
 * A base class for node combiner implementations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A <em>node combiner</em> is an object that knows how two hierarchical node
 * structures can be combined into a single one. Of course, there are many
 * possible ways of implementing such a combination, e.g. constructing a union,
 * an intersection, or an "override" structure (were nodes in the first
 * hierarchy take precedence over nodes in the second hierarchy). This abstract
 * base class only provides some helper methods and defines the common interface
 * for node combiners. Concrete sub classes will implement the diverse
 * combination algorithms.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For some concrete combiner implementations it is important to distinguish
 * whether a node is a single node or whether it belongs to a list structure.
 * Alone from the input structures, the combiner will not always be able to make
 * this decision. So sometimes it may be necessary for the developer to
 * configure the combiner and tell it, which nodes should be treated as list
 * nodes. For this purpose the <code>addListNode()</code> method exists. It
 * can be passed the name of a node, which should be considered a list node.
 * </p>
