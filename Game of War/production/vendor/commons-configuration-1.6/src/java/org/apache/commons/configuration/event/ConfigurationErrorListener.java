 * An event listener interface to be implemented by observers that are

 * properties.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some configuration classes use an underlying storage where each access of a
 * property can cause an exception. In earlier versions of this library such
 * exceptions were typically ignored. By implementing this interface and
 * registering at a configuration object as an error listener it is now possible
 * for clients to receive notifications about those internal problems.
