/**
 * <p>
 * A simple data class used by <code>{@link ExpressionEngine}</code> to store
 * the results of the <code>prepareAdd()</code> operation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a new property is to be added to a configuration, the affected
 * <code>Configuration</code> object must know, where in its hierarchy of
 * configuration nodes new elements have to be added. This information is
 * obtained by an <code>ExpressionEngine</code> object that interprets the key
 * of the new property. This expression engine will pack all information
 * necessary for the configuration to perform the add operation in an instance
 * of this class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Information managed by this class contains:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the configuration node, to which new elements must be added</li>
 * <li>the name of the new node</li>
 * <li>whether the new node is a child node or an attribute node</li>
 * <li>if a whole branch is to be added at once, the names of all nodes between
 * the parent node (the target of the add operation) and the new node</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
