/**
 * <p>
 * An event class that is used for reporting errors that occurred while
 * processing configuration properties.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some configuration implementations (e.g.
 * <code>{@link org.apache.commons.configuration.DatabaseConfiguration}</code>
 * or <code>{@link org.apache.commons.configuration.JNDIConfiguration}</code>
 * use an underlying storage that can throw an exception on each property
 * access. In earlier versions of this library such exceptions were logged and
 * then silently ignored. This makes it impossible for a client to find out that
 * something went wrong.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To give clients better control over the handling of errors that occur during
 * access of a configuration object a new event listener mechanism specific for
 * exceptions is introduced: Clients can register itself at a configuration
 * object as an <em>error listener</em> and are then notified about all
 * internal errors related to the source configuration object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By inheriting from <code>ConfigurationEvent</code> this event class
 * supports all properties that describe an operation on a configuration
 * instance. In addition a <code>Throwable</code> object is available
 * representing the occurred error. The event's type determines the operation
 * that caused the error. Note that depending on the event type and the occurred
 * exception not all of the other properties (e.g. name of the affected property
 * or its value) may be available.
 * </p>
