/**
 * <p>
 * A specialized hierarchical configuration class that wraps a single node of
 * its parent configuration.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Configurations of this type are initialized with a parent configuration and a
 * configuration node of this configuration. This node becomes the root node of
 * the subnode configuration. All property accessor methods are evaluated
 * relative to this root node. A good use case for a
 * <code>SubnodeConfiguration</code> is when multiple properties from a
 * specific sub tree of the whole configuration need to be accessed. Then a
 * <code>SubnodeConfiguration</code> can be created with the parent node of
 * the affected sub tree as root node. This allows for simpler property keys and
 * is also more efficient.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A subnode configuration and its parent configuration operate on the same
 * hierarchy of configuration nodes. So if modifications are performed at the
 * subnode configuration, these changes are immideately visible in the parent
 * configuration. Analogously will updates of the parent configuration affect
 * the subnode configuration if the sub tree spanned by the subnode
 * configuration's root node is involved.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are however changes at the parent configuration, which cause the
 * subnode configuration to become detached. An example for such a change is a
 * reload operation of a file-based configuration, which replaces all nodes of
 * the parent configuration. The subnode configuration per default still
 * references the old nodes. Another example are list structures: a subnode
 * configuration can be created to point on the <em>i</em>th element of the
 * list. Now list elements can be added or removed, so that the list elements'
 * indices change. In such a scenario the subnode configuration would always
 * point to the same list element, regardless of its current index.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To solve these problems and make a subnode configuration aware of
 * such structural changes of its parent, it is possible to associate a
 * subnode configuration with a configuration key. This can be done by calling
 * the <code>setSubnodeKey()</code> method. If here a key is set, the subnode
 * configuration will evaluate it on each access, thus ensuring that it is
 * always in sync with its parent. In this mode the subnode configuration really
 * behaves like a live-view on its parent. The price for this is a decreased
 * performance because now an additional evaluation has to be performed on each
 * property access. So this mode should only be used if necessary; if for
 * instance a subnode configuration is only used for a temporary convenient
 * access to a complex configuration, there is no need to make it aware for
 * structural changes of its parent. If a subnode configuration is created
 * using the <code>{@link HierarchicalConfiguration#configurationAt(String, boolean)
 * configurationAt()}</code> method of <code>HierarchicalConfiguration</code>
 * (which should be the preferred way), with an additional boolean parameter it
 * can be specified whether the resulting subnode configuration should be
 * aware of structural changes or not. Then the configuration key will be
 * automatically set.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <em>Note:</em> At the moment support for creating a subnode configuration
 * that is aware of structural changes of its parent from another subnode
 * configuration (a "sub subnode configuration") is limited. This only works if
 * <ol><li>the subnode configuration that serves as the parent for the new
 * subnode configuration is itself associated with a configuration key and</li>
 * <li>the key passed in to create the new subnode configuration is not too
 * complex (if configuration keys are used that contain indices, a corresponding
 * key that is valid from the parent configuration's point of view cannot be
 * constructed).</li></ol>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a subnode configuration is created, it inherits the settings of its
 * parent configuration, e.g. some flags like the
 * <code>throwExceptionOnMissing</code> flag or the settings for handling list
 * delimiters) or the expression engine. If these settings are changed later in
 * either the subnode or the parent configuration, the changes are not visible
 * for each other. So you could create a subnode configuration, change its
 * expression engine without affecting the parent configuration.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * From its purpose this class is quite similar to
 * <code>{@link SubsetConfiguration}</code>. The difference is that a subset
 * configuration of a hierarchical configuration may combine multiple
 * configuration nodes from different sub trees of the configuration, while all
 * nodes in a subnode configuration belong to the same sub tree. If an
 * application can live with this limitation, it is recommended to use this
 * class instead of <code>SubsetConfiguration</code> because creating a subset
 * configuration is more expensive than creating a subnode configuration.
 * </p>
