/**
 * <p>
 * A concrete combiner implementation that is able to construct an override
 * combination.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An <em>override combination</em> means that nodes in the first node
 * structure take precedence over nodes in the second, or - in other words -
 * nodes of the second structure are only added to the resulting structure if
 * they do not occure in the first one. This is especially suitable for dealing
 * with the properties of configurations that are defined in an
 * <code>override</code> section of a configuration definition file (hence the
 * name).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This combiner will iterate over the second node hierarchy and find all nodes
 * that are not contained in the first hierarchy; these are added to the result.
 * If a node can be found in both structures, it is checked whether a
 * combination (in a recursive way) can be constructed for the two, which will
 * then be added. Per default, nodes are combined, which occur only once in both
 * structures. This test is implemented in the <code>canCombine()</code>
 * method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As is true for the <code>{@link UnionCombiner}</code>, for this combiner
 * list nodes are important. The <code>addListNode()</code> can be called to
 * declare certain nodes as list nodes. This has the effect that these nodes
 * will never be combined.
 * </p>
