            <p>
                Commons VFS provides a single API for accessing
                various different file systems. It presents a uniform view of
                the files from various different sources, such as the files on
                local disk, on an HTTP server, or inside a Zip archive.
            </p>

            <p>Some of the features of Commons VFS are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A single consistent API for accessing files of different
                    types.
                </li>
                <li>Support for numerous

                    Caching of file information. Caches information in-JVM,
                    and optionally can cache remote file information on the
                    local file system.

                    Support for logical file systems made up of files from
                    various different file systems.

			<p>
				VFS is splitted into core, examples and sandbox now.
			</p>
			<p>
				Due to some technical reasons we had to move the webdav and jcifs (smb) filesystem to
				the sandbox. So if you need one of these filesystems you have to build VFS manually.
			</p>
			<p>
				To build VFS, it will be best to check-it-out from svn and use maven 2 to
				build all at once - Notice: the ant and maven 1 build will just build the core.
			</p>
			<p>
				And - we have a new filesystem: mime (read only for sure)<br/>
				This filesystem allows you to read e-mails like archives, e.g. the attachments are the
				children of the mail itself.<br />
				You'll find it in our sandbox.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also notice that we now have a "3rd party plugins" page. It will list all external
				plugins available for VFS.<br />
				You have such a beast - and will get listed? Just drop me a mail: imario -at- apache.org
