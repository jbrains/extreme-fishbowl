        <p>Provides an API for validating internal consistency among attributes. </p>
         
        <p>Many times, an attribute will only make sense in some context.
        For example, you may have one attribute that must either be applied to no methods,
        or to all methods in a class. An attribute may require the presence of another
        attribute.
        
        <p>The AttributeValidatorTask Ant task and its API enables you to define those rules
        and run them as part of your regular build.
